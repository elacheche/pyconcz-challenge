# Red Hatâ€“PyCon CZ Coding Challenge

We have prepared 3 programming problems for you to solve so you can win a prize and maybe even a job at Red Hat!

## Rules

To solve the 3 problems you may use *only* the Python 3 programming language and it's standard library, __no external libraries are allowed__. Your script also has to finish within 2 minutes on a reasonably powerful machine.

**Submit** your scripts through our [web interface](https://pyconcz.fedoralovespython.org/) before the **deadline on Friday at 14:00h**.

## Testing

We have prepared tests which you can use to verify that your solution is correct. However, after submission your script will be checked by more rigorous private tests to make it infeasible to exploit them.

To start the test go into the directory of the given problem, write the solution into the prepared file and then run the tests:

    $ python3 -m pytest test_public.py   TODO

Beware that the tests do not check whether your script terminates within the allotted 2 minutes.

## Problems

1. [Restricted sum](level1-restricted-sum/README.md)
2. [Brackets](level2-brackets/README.md)
3. [Build Order](level3-dependencies/README.md)

## Contact

If you have any questions, contact us at python-maint@redhat.com or at the Red Hat booth.
